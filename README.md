# Virtual-Jenga
This allows you to play a game of Jenga with your computer without any robotic parts. You do have to make the moves for the computer, however.

# Functionality
  The game is played on the command console, and you start by choosing which layer you would like to pick from, and then which piece index (1 - 3) you 
 want to remove from that layer. The bot then calculates possibly valid moves, and requests you check which of the moves it suggests have loose pieces.
 If there are no valid moves the bot concedes.
